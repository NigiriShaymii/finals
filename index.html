    <h1> Contradicting the Moment </h1>
    <p> There is always someone who accidentally bypass or exploit the flaws of the rules. Any rules!
      From technology to the government, a person or a group can use this to their advantage to
      get away with their objective. To that, a being, abided and fond to the rules will
      become frustrated and expose the imperfect rules using the exploiter as a reference.
      "Contradicting the Moment" captures the spectator's expression in a discombobulated fashion
      towards a particular moment when an action or an object defies against the rules in a property
      or a being. </p>

    <h2> Inspiration </h2>
    <p> When I was taking pictures and wandering around the San Jose State University campus,
      I saw a sign about preventing the use of straws placed next to the Starbucks counter crowded
      with their green, plastic straws. I was intrigued that someone have the audacity to share
      the dangers of plastic straws in front of a popular coffee shop chain that produces millions
      and billions of straws. The context strikes me as odd but an intriguing point. Therefore,
      I want to give my own take of two objects or actions juxtiposing each other and how that
      applies to the real world and the laws they are build from humane foundations. </p>
