      <h2> What are we about? </h2>
      <p> Policing Rules Exploiters is a community that reports any human phenomenon
        that goes against what the law stands for. We do not tolerate people who
        defy the rules. What is set is always set for the employees, the pedestrians,
        the homeless, the children, and so forth. The authority have the rights to establish
        what's best for us and bond with those said laws. It is for our protection.

        The following video will showcase the rule breakers and benders. See how outrageous
        they've evolved over time.
