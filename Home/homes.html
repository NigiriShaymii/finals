  <h1> Welcome to P.R.E.</h1>

  <h2> What are we about? </h2>
  <p> Policing Rules Exploiters is a community that reports any human phenomenon
    that goes against what the law stands for. We do not tolerate people who
    defy the rules. What is set is always set for the employees, the pedestrians,
    the homeless, the children, and so forth. The authority have the rights to establish
    what's best for us and bond with those said laws. It is for our protection.

    <br>

    The following video will showcase the rule breakers and benders. See how outrageous
    they've evolved over time.
